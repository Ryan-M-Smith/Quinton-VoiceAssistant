# Quinton ToolKits

## Coming soon (expected v1.0.0)

---

ToolKits are a type of expansion system for Quinton-VoiceAssistant. Their purpose is to add functionality
(such as new recognizable commands) to the software. These can be created by me and built into the software,
or they can be created by users and installed personally.

**NOTE:** The _projected_ stable release number for this feature is v1.0.0. This version number is subject to
change and is not a final deadline. This is only because ToolKits will be a considered a major feature and will
cause the major version number to be incremented. Also note that it is likely that betas will be released with some
experimental ToolKit features (starting at v1.0.0-alpha).
