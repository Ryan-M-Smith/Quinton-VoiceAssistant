# Quinton ToolKits

## Coming soon (expected v1.0.0)

### Introduction

ToolKits are a type of expansion system for Quinton-VoiceAssistant. Their purpose is to add functionality
(such as new recognizable commands) to the software. These can be created by me and built into the software,
or they can be created by users and installed personally.

**NOTE:** The _projected_ stable release number for this feature is v1.0.0. This version number is subject to
change and is not a final deadline. This is only because ToolKits will be a considered a major feature and will
cause the major version number to be incremented. Also note that betas will be released with some experimental 
ToolKit features (starting at v1.0.0-alpha).

### 2020-12-13: An update about the first pre-release

The first pre-release of v1.0.0 is about 40% done. This pre-release will add the ability to use a ToolKit in a reply.
Here's what you will and won't see in v1.0.0-alpha.

* **Included**
  * A (mostly) functional command-reply sequence that works with a ToolKit
  * Some (unfinalized) documentation on how to create a ToolKit
  * A template ToolKit
  
* **Not yet included**
  * The ability to use multiple ToolKits at once
  * The ability to get replies from the cache that were created by a ToolKit (i.e., cache integration)
  * ToolKit exclusion (i.e., a way to blacklist ToolKits)
