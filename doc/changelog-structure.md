# Quinton-VoiceAssistant Changelog Structure

* In the changelog, each entry will be titled with the software version
  and the release date. In general the heading will be in the form
  `vX.Y.Z - Released yyyy-mm-dd` where:
  * `X` is the major version number
  * `Y` is the minor version number
  * `Z` is the patch number
  * `yyyy` is the release year
  * `mm` is the release month (`01`-`12`)
  * and `dd` is the release date (`01`-`31`)

* Under these entry headings, there will be categories of changes in the
  following order:
  * Added - Additions to the codebase
  * Changed - Changes to existing code
  * Fixed - Bugfixes
  * Deprecated - Depreactions within the codebase
  * Removed - Removals from the codebase

* Under each category, the changes will be sorted based on how important I
  think the changes are.
  * The top changes from each category then get to be
    in the release notes on GitHub.
