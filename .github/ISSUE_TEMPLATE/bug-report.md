When generating an issue to report a bug for Quinton-VoiceAssistant, try to answer the following
questions to help me understand what's wrong.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Choose a severity level**
A severity level helps me gauge how quickly I need to fix the bug. Most bugs will likely fit
somewhere in the range of numbers 1-3, but 4 and 5 are always possibilities and are there
for a reason. The levels are:

1. Little to no significance/Not really sure
2. A minor bug that won't affect most users
3. A bug that causes a problem, but the software is still largely or completely usable
4. A major bug that impedes usage of the software
5. A bug resulting in a fatal error where the code won't build, execute, or run properly, or
    that causes the program to crash

**Explain how you discovered this bug**
For example:

* I spoke the command _x_, and _y_ (unexpectedly) happened
* I don't think _x_ is working properly

**Optional: Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. If you aren't sure, don't feel
pressured to write anything here

**System and version info**
In the case of a system-specific bug, knowing what OS you're using will help. Also, a bug in
an older version of the software may have been already fixed. In this case, an upgrade should
fix your problem.

* Operating System (e.g., Debian Linux)
* Software version (e.g. Quinton-VoiceAssistant v0.3.2)

**Additional context**
Add anything else you'd like me to know about the problem here.
