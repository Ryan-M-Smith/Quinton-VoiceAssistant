## When submitting a feature request for Quinton-VoiceAssistant, consider a few things first.

**Would this feature help everyone, or just me?**
I would prefer that feature requests be something that helped improve the software and 
user experience overall rather than just proposed a bunch of additions that very few people 
would find useful. If you aren't sure, I can always help you decide.

**[FUTURE] Can the functionality be achieved through a ToolKit?**
As you might already know, Quinton ToolKits are under active development. Once they are
officially released, users will be able to implement their own commands into the software as 
3rd party extensions to the already existing code.

### If you meet any of the above criteria, see below this section. Otherwise, answer the following 
questions to submit your request:

**What do you wish the software could do that it currently can't? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of your request (e.g., I wish Quinton-VoiceAssistant supported _x_ or did _y_).

**Additional context**
Write anything else you want to tell me about your feature request here.

### If you met any of the criteria, sorry about that. Here are a few things you can do about it though.

**Submit a request anyway**
Just because it meet the criteria doesn't mean it isn't important. Still feel free to submit your 
request, just know there is no guarantee it will be implemented.

**Implement the feature yourself**
If you're interested, fork my repository and implement your feature. Ask me to review it, and if it's really good, I might even put it in the software.

**[FUTURE] Write a ToolKit, if applicable**
A great way to add those few commands that would help you out and make your experience 10x better.
