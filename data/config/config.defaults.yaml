# This is Quinton's configuration file.
#
# Feel free to modify at your own risk. If you are interested in adding custom config
# variables, please read `../doc/custom-config.md`.
#
# If you make a detrimental mistake that you can't reverse...you may have to reinstall
# the software.
#
# Notes about editing:
#   * Note that tabs (4 spaces) ARE NOT allowed in YAML! Please use 2 spaces for any indentation.
#
#   * All variable values are non-case-sensitive unless otherwise stated.
#
#   * While this is true, please, don't use mixed case (e.g., hElLo WoRlD)
#
#   * Only edit what you think you can safely edit without breaking the software.
#     Each YAML document is labeled so you know how important the following config
#     is.
#
#   * Some sets of config variables are only used if a higher level variable is set to
#     use a specific feature (e.g., data logging in Document 2). In these cases, you may not
#     need to set every single variable that follows. For each specific case, follow the directions 
#     in the document you are editing.
#
#   * "Ability to run" doesn't mean "works the same as it did before." A better translation
#     (at least in this case) would be: "doesn't crash, break, or fail to execute." For example,
#     raising the value of the `time_limit` variable in Document 1 may cause Quinton to take ages  
#     to reply to a command, but it still (eventually) works, thus not impeding its ability to run.
#
#   * Please, don't pad strings with spaces. This WILL mess up Quinton's ability to run. For example,
#     adding a space to the value of the `country` variable will cause all requests regarding weather 
#     to fail
#
#   * While the config uses `true` and `false` by default to represent boolean values, feel free to use 
#     `yes`/`no` or `y`/`n` if you prefer.

# Document 1: User preferences. All of these can be safely edited without
# messing up Quinton's ability to run.

username: "user" # Your name here
wake_word: "Hey Quinton"
units: "imperial" # "imperial" (default) or "metric"

# Set this to your timezone. Any timezone will work, as long as you use the correct code. For more
# information, please see `../doc/locale.md`. The code must be typed EXACTLY as it as listed in the 
# reference.
timezone: "America/New_York"

# If you want Quinton to know and use your location, set `use_location` to `true`.
# If you don't, set it to `false`. NOTE: With the variable set to `false`, NONE of Quinton's
# weather functionality works.
use_location: true # `true` (default) or `false`

location_pref: # If `use_location` is `false`, you can don't have to set these
  city: "Ellicott City" # Use your city name; CASE SENSITIVE
  country: "US" # Must be a two-character ISO 3166 country code; CASE AND LENGTH SENSITIVE (see `../doc/locale.md`)

# The length of time in seconds Quinton waits for a command after hearing its wake word. If this 
# amount of time elapses and there is no speech, Quinton moves back into listening mode.
timeout: 4

# The length of time in seconds Quinton waits for a command to finish after it has been started. If this 
# amount of time elapses, Quinton will detect everything that was picked up.
time_limit: 6

# To detect its wake word, Quinton listens for 3 seconds at a time before parsing the audio data to
# check if the wake word/phrase was uttered. However, that 3-second interval can be changed. A lower
# value will cause Quinton to check more often, thus resulting in a faster response, but you may have 
# less time to speak. Higher values lower the possibility of speaking during the time when a check is 
# running, but as of now, Quinton will have to continue to record for the duration of this value before
# the audio data can be parsed. This means potentially longer response times.
ww_detect_time: 3

speaker_vol: 100 # The speaker volume. This is how loud you will hear Quinton's voice. Scale: 0 (Min/Muted) - 100 (Max)
mic_vol: 50 # The microphone volume. This is how loud you will hear Quinton's voice. Scale: 0 (Min/Muted) - 100 (Max)

pause: 0.2 # The length of time Quinton waits before returning to listening mode (after giving a reply).

# Document 2: Log preferences. Modifying one of these without knowing what it does
# may cause Quinton to malfunction, but not terribly. If you are just looking for a
# way to disable all data logging, set `log-data` to `false` and you can safely move on.
#
# NOTE: If `log_data` is `true`:
#   * You should also look at setting the cache clear frequency.
#   * Changing any settings under `log_pref` will do NOTHING.
#
log_data: true # Select from: `true` (default), `false`, or `"custom"` (quotes are required, backticks aren't)

clear_frequency: "annually" # Select from: "daily", "weekly", "monthly", "annually" (default), "never"

# The info in this dictionary is only used  if `log-data` is set to "custom". If you have 
# `log-data` set to "custom", please set the following to `true` or `false` (unless otherwise 
# specified).

    archive_audio_commands: true
    
    timestamp_history: true # If either of the above variables are `false`, this isn't used.

# Document 3: Voice preferences. Modifying these manipulate the way Quinton sounds to the user.
# CAUTION: Messing these up can cause Quinton not to work as expected. If an unrecognized voice
# is used, the speech engine with either throw an error or use the default voice.
# NOTE FOR EDITING: Mbrola voices can be used instead of the builtins. For more information on Quinton's voice, 
# how to change it, and how/where to find a complete list, please see the Espeak man page (`man espeak`) or
# `../doc/voices.md` (Quinton documentation). Unless otherwise noted, all parameters here come set to Espeak's defaults.

voice: "en-us+m1" # See `../doc/voices.md` for different options and more information. This is the voice I picked; Espeak's default is called "default".

# The speech speed can be more than this, but it is not recommended that the level exceed 500.
speed: 160 # Espeak's defaults have this value at 100. For the voice I've picked, I think this sounds better.
pitch: 50 # Voice pitch, from 0 to 99.
